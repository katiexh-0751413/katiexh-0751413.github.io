      <h2 class="overview">Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p>For this project, I created 6 sketches using JavaScript.
              <ol>
                <li>Static: <br><IMG SRC="images/sketch1gif.gif" height="150"></li>
                <li>Random: <br><IMG SRC="images/sketch2gif.gif" height="150"></li>
                <li>Infinite loop: <br> <IMG SRC="images/sketch3gif.gif" height="150"></li>
                <li>Interactive: <br> <IMG SRC="images/sketch4gif.gif" height="150"></li>
                <li>Audio: <br> <IMG SRC="images/sketch5gif.gif" height="150"></li>
                <li>Audio and Visuals: <br> <IMG SRC="images/sketch6gif.gif" height="150"></li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Here is my <a href="https://katiexh-0751413.github.io/mp2gallery.html">gallery</a>
           if you would like to view all my sketches.</p>
        <h2 class="development process">Development Process</h2>
        <p>I broke up MP2 into several steps to complete the project:
          <ol>
            <li>First, I created each sketch in an online browser using the
              <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/">p5.js online web editor</a>.<br><br>
              <IMG SRC="images/sketch3inprogress.png" height="300"> <br>
                <em>In progress screenshot of Sketch 3 in the p5.js web editor</em>
            </li> <br>
            <li>Once I completed all 6 of my sketches, I created the gallery that would
              hold each of my sketches and added each sketch to it. <br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/galleryinprogress.png" height="300"> <br>
                <em>In progress screenshot of MP2 Gallery</em>
            </li> <br>
            <li>Lastly, I completed the writeup for MP2.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      <h2 class="issue">Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>An issue I ran into during MP2 was getting Sketch 6 to work as intended.
            I wanted to draw a sine wave in which its wavelength and amplitude depend on
            the frequency and amplitude of the sound waves produced by the user
            dragging their mouse across the screen, respectively. The main difficulty
            of this was scaling it to fit on the display screen appropriately.</p>
          <p> To solve this issue, I had to scale the angle and y accordingly. I
            achieved this by a simple process of trial and error. Eventually I settled
            on scaling the angle by a factor of 0.01, and the y by a factor of 200,
            and this did the trick.</p>

      <h2 class="ideasandfuture">Ideas and Future</h2>
      <p>Here are some ideas and features I might like to add to my project in the
        future:
        <ul>
          <li> Creating some additional sketches and putting them up in my gallery.</li> <br>
          <li> Modifying some of the current sketches I already have and making them
            more aesthetically pleasing or giving them an additional functionality.</li> <br>
          <li> Modifying the colors in my current sketches so that they all match
            with each other to give the site a more overall seamless look.</li> <br>
        </ul>
      </p>
