      <h1 class="header">Final Project Prototype Writeup</h1>
      <h2 class="overview">Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p>For my final project, I decided to create a simple sketch app using
          P5.js that allows the user to draw, erase, pick the size of pen or
          eraser, choose a color for the pen, clear canvas, and save their work.</p>
        <p>In order to use my drawing app, you can simply open the
          <a href="https://katiexh-0751413.github.io/PaintPrototype/">Paint Prototype</a>
          from the link and paint from there directly. Alternatively, you could download the code from my <a href=
        "https://github.com/katiexh-0751413/PaintPrototype">GitHub Respository</a> and run it from your local server.</p>

        <h2 class="development process">Development Process</h2>
        <p>I broke this project up into several steps to complete it:
          <ol>
            <li>First, I copied this <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/owenroberts/sketches/Bkik3aw2z">P5.js Code</a>
              that already has a very basic drawing app into another P5 editor.</li> <br>
            <li>Then, I removed the red and blue buttons and changed the canvas to be white
              so that I would have a blank screen to start with.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/prototypeIP1.png" height="300"></li> <br>
            <li>Then I added a menu bar to the top of the window and made it gray.
              This way, we can add buttons to the menu bar later on.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/prototypeIP2.png" height="300"> <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>After this, I added buttons for "clear" and "save" so that the
              user can clear the canvas or save their drawing as a PNG.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/prototypeIP3.png" height="300"> <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>Then I added buttons for an Eraser and Pen so that the user can
              erase certain parts of their work if they wish.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/prototypeIP4.png" height="300"> <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>I added a color panel so the user can pick a pen color from the
              options provided.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/prototypeIP5.png" height="300"> <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>At the very end, I added in a slider to allow the user to adjust
              the size of pen or eraser to their liking.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/prototypeIP6.png" height="300"> <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>Lastly, I copied and pasted my code over from the P5 online environment
              into VSCode and pushed the changes to my GitHub repository. Then I deployed
              it to GitHub Pages so that it's usable on a real website instead of just
              my local server.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      <h2 class="issue">Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>I actually didn't have very significant issues in the programming part of this assignment,
            but I ran into an issue when trying to deploy my website using GitHub Pages. Every
            time I tried to deploy, I kept getting this issue for some reason: <br> <br>
          <IMG SRC="images/prototypeissue.png" height="300"></p>
          <p>I tried so many different things, such as creating a new GitHub repository for my
            project, adding a folder into my portfolio to contain the files instead, and ultimately
            went back to the original repository because I was then getting a blank page after the
            GitHub Pages were deployed. Then I found that the issue was in my HTML file, so I fixed
            the errors and now it works.</p>

      <h2 class="ideasandfuture">Ideas and Future</h2>
      <p>Here are some ideas and features I might like to add to my project in the
        future for the final version:
        <ul>
          <li> Adding an "undo" and "redo" button, allowing the user to go back or add back another stroke.</li> <br>
          <li> Adding a "Shapes" option that allows the user to select a shape to draw. For example,
            if they click on a circle icon, it will allow them to draw a perfect circle.</li> <br>
          <li> This was one of my stretch goals, but adding a "fill" button that allows the user to
               fill a certain area with a certain color. For example, if they drew a circle and would
               like to color the circle red, they can use the "fill" option to easily do that.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="kudos">Kudos</h2>
      <p>Here are some resources I found useful while working on this project:
        <ul>
          <li>This basic <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/owenroberts/sketches/Bkik3aw2z">
            P5 drawing app</a> example.</li> <br>
          <li>This <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createSlider">P5 slider reference.</a></li> <br>
          <li>This <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/saveCanvas">P5 saveCanvas referece</a>, which
               was helpful for creating my "save" button.</li> <br>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="projectscope">Project Scope</h2>
      <p>Now that I've completed my prototype, I think I was a bit ambitious in some of the
        functions that I wanted to implement. For example, filling a shape is going to be a lot
        of additional work that I did not plan for, and even drawing a shape was more work than
        I originally anticipated. I actually tried to do the shape feature as part of the prototype
        since I finished most other things, but I couldn't figure it out so that may need to wait
        for the final prototype or I may need to adjust some things around as needed.</p>

      <h2 class="timemanagement">Time Management</h2>
      <p>I think overall, the prototype took me about as long as I expected but I did not
        expect to run into that issue with deployment so that was definitely frustrating. For my
        MP3 game and portfolio website, deployment was not an issue at all so I was really
        surprised it wasn't working here. It probably took me several hours just to figure that
        part out, unfortunately.</p>

      <h2 class="implementationplan">Implementnation Plan</h2>
      <p>I adjusted a few things from my original envisioned interface (in my proposal
        writeup). For example, I moved the "clear" button to the opposite side of the menu
        from "save" rather than having them right next to each other so that users
        don't accidentally clear their entire drawing when they're trying to save it,
        since that would be pretty bad UI design.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I may add or cut some features depending on how difficult the
        implementation ends up being for those features, such as the "draw shape" or
        "fill" features. I may add something else instead if those end up being too
        difficult or time consuming.</p>
