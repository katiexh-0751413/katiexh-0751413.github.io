      <h1 class="header">Final Project Prototype Writeup</h1>
      <h2 class="overview">Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p>For my final project, I decided to create a simple sketch app using
          P5.js that allows the user to draw, erase, pick the size of pen or
          eraser, choose a color for the pen, clear canvas, and save their work.</p>
        <p>In order to run my game, you can simply open the <a href="https://katiexh-0751413.github.io/MP3game/">Flappy Bird Game</a>
          from the link and play the game directly. Alternatively, you could download the code from my <a href=
        "https://github.com/katiexh-0751413/MP3game">GitHub Respository</a> and run it from your local server.</p>

        <h2 class="development process">Development Process</h2>
        <p>I broke this project up into several steps to complete it:
          <ol>
            <li>First, I followed this <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/platformer/">Platform Tutorial</a> that
              teaches you how to build an endless runner.
            </li> <br>
            <li>Once I got the tutorial working, I began making changes to it to make it gradually
              more similar to a Flappy Bird game. For example, I made the ground all green and the
              obstacles into long rectangles instead of squares randomly scattered across the screen.
              I made two obstacle sprites, an upper and a lower one, then created a gap in between them
              for the player to jump through.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/mp3ip1.png" height="300"> <br>
                <em>In progress screenshot of MP3 Game</em>
            </li> <br>
            <li>Then, I randomized where the gaps will be and loaded in images for the bird, background,
              and ground. I also changed the scoring so that points will only increase by one every time
              the player jumps through a pair of pipes.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/mp3ip2.png" height="300"> <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>Then I loaded in images for the obstacles.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/mp3final.png" height="300"> <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>Lastly, I loaded in sound for when the player jumps, scores a point, and dies.<br> <br>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      <h2 class="issue">Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>I actually didn't have very significant issues in the programming part of this assignment,
            but I ran into an issue when trying to deploy my website using GitHub Pages.
          </p>

      <h2 class="ideasandfuture">Ideas and Future</h2>
      <p>Here are some ideas and features I might like to add to my project in the
        future for the final version:
        <ul>
          <li> Adding an "undo" and "redo" button, allowing the user to go back or add back another stroke.</li> <br>
          <li> Adding a "Shapes" option that allows the user to select a shape to draw. For example,
            if they click on a circle icon, it will allow them to draw a perfect circle.</li> <br>
          <li> This was one of my stretch goals, but adding a "fill" button that allows the user to
               fill a certain area with a certain color. For example, if they drew a circle and would
               like to color the circle red, they can use the "fill" option to easily do that.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="kudos">Kudos</h2>
      <p>Here are some resources I found useful while working on this project:
        <ul>
          <li>This <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/platformer/">
            Platformer Tutorial</a></li> <br>
          <li>These <a href="https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/">P5 Examples</a>
              demonstrating P5.play's core functionalities.</li> <br>
          <li><a href="https://repl.it/languages/html">Repl.it</a>'s website, as it allowed me to write my code
              online and run it while seeing the immediate results on my screen. This made debugging my code much
              easier.</li> <br>
        </ul>
