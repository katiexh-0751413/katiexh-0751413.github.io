      <h1 class="header">MP0 Writeup</h1>
      <h2 class="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>I broke up MP0 into several steps to complete the project:
          <ol>
            <li>I worked on some basic style and aesthetics for the main page.
              I changed the background and text colors in the index.css file,
              and rewrote the text to represent what I wanted my portfolio to
              say. I also changed the font of the text.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
              I created some tabs at the top of the home page to link to other
              pages, including Home, About Me, Cheatsheets, and MP0 Writeup.
              Then I added my first CSS transition, which was to make the tab inverse
              colors when the user hovers over it with their mouse. Originally
              I ran into some issues with creating my CSS transition. When
              trying to make the tabs inverse colors, I wanted it to go from a
              black background with white text to a white background with black
              text. However, in doing this I accidentally created a black
              background for the images as well:
              <br> <br>
                <img class="picture-container" src="/images/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" />
            </li> <br>
            <li> I created new HTML and CSS files in VSCode to customize those
              pages, then customized them through the code.</li> <br>
              <li> In the "About Me" page, I wrote a description about myself
                and added an image of myself to the page.
              </li> <br>
              <li> In the "Cheatsheets" page, I pasted the code snippet I used
                to create my CSS transition, which was the tab bars changing
                colors when hovering over them with the mouse. I changed the
                font of the code the match the font usually used when coding,
                called Courier.
              </li> <br>
              <li> Then, I wrote up the MP0 writeup, describing each step
                along the way, an issue encountered while working on this
                project, my CSS transition I used, and ideas I might implement
                in the future.
              </li> <br>
              <li> After I completed this, I decided to go back and create another CSS transition
                where I would make the intro (where it says "Hello, I'm Katie!") pink with shadows
                under the letters and have all the letters bouncing.
              </li> <br>
              <li> Lastly, I am now updating the rest of my project to reflect these changes, such
                as in my "Cheatsheets" page and here in the "MP0 Writeup" page.
              </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      <h2 class="issue">Issue</h2>
          <p> An issue I encountered while working on this assignment was
            getting my first CSS transition to work properly in the beginning. I
            wanted to make the tabs at the top of the page inverse colors when
            the user hovers over it with their mouse (originally black
            background with white text, then white background with black text).
            However, when I tried to implement this it created a black
            background for the images on my page as well, which is not what I
            intended to do.
          </p>
          <p> I realized that the reason it was affecting the images as well as
            the tabs was because in my CSS code, I was putting all these changes
            under the "a" tag, while both my tabs and images were under "a" tags.
          </p>
          <p> To fix this issue, I added "class="nav-container"" inside the "a"
            tag for the navigation bar, but not to the images in the HTML file.
            Then I changed the CSS to say ".nav-container", ".nav-container:hover",
            and ".nav-container:focus", rather than "a", "a:hover", and
            "a:focus", and this finally solved the issue.
          </p>

          <p> Currently, another issue I am having is figuring out how to create
            a gif of my CSS transitions to include in the MP0 Writeup, but I have
            not yet figured out how to solve this issue (although presumably I will
            have by the time I turn in this assignment).
          </p>
      <h2 class="csstransition">CSS Transition</h2>
      <!-- CSS Transition: A description of the CSS transition you implemented,
      why you chose it, and how you made it work, with a gif of it in action -->
      <p> I decided to create two CSS transitions for this project. </p>
      <p>My first CSS transition was to make the tab change colors when the user
        hovers over it with their mouse. </p>

        <p> The reason I chose this CSS transition was because I already have to
          make tabs anyway to link to the other parts of the site, so I decided
          to just make the tabs a little more aesthetic and fun, as opposed to
          some simple links at the top of the page.
        </p>

      <p>To make this work, I set the original color in the HTML to be black
        tabs with white text for the words, wrapping the code with "nav" and
        "nav-container". Then in the CSS for these tags I just assigned
        "".nav-container:hover" and ".nav-container:focus" to new colors (I
        chose pink text with a white background to match my introduction phrase),
        and that was it!
      </p>

      <p>Originally I ran into some issues with creating my CSS transition. When
        trying to make the tabs change colors, I wanted it to go from a black
        background with white text to a white background with black text (This
        was before I decided to make it pink text with a white background). However,
        in doing this I accidentally created a black background for the images
        as well, as shown up above in #2 in the "Overview" section.</p>

        <p> Here is a gif of the transition in action: </p>
        <IMG SRC="images/gif1.gif">

        <p> My second CSS transition was to make my introduction on index.html
          (the part that says "Hello, I'm Katie!") pink with shadows and to have
          the letters be continuously bouncing on the screen.
        </p>

        <p> I decided to do this CSS transition because my first one was more for
          functionality of the site, but I wanted to do another one that was just
          for fun and to make the site a little more interesting and fun.
        </p>

        <p> This one was a lot more complicated than the first one. I had to
          separate each character in the phrase in the HTML code and give them
          all a separate tag so that I could customize them differently in the
          CSS and make them bounce at different times so the entire phrase wasn't
          all one big bounce. Then I adjusted things like the text color and shadows,
          and then I implemented the bounce by adding a "@keyframes bounce"
          section in the CSS that would set how big the bounce would be and stuff
          like that. I set the bounce to be a 1 second transition with an ease
          so that it slows it down a little and makes the transition seem more gradual.
        </p>

        <p> Here is a gif of the transition in action:</p>
        <IMG SRC="images/gif2.gif">

      <h2 class="ideasandfuture">Ideas and Future</h2>
      <p>Here are some ideas and features I might like to add to my site in the
        future:
        <ul>
          <li> Adding another CSS transition on my home page for
            fun, potentially a gif next to my introduction or having my
            introduction move when the user hovers over it.
          </li> <br>
          <li> Putting some more information in the "Cheatsheets" tab, such as
            some shortcuts or tips I found useful that I may want to refer to
            later on.</li> <br>
          <li> Currently under the "Projects" section on the home page I just
            have the original images and links that were provided, but as I
            continue to build and work on my portfolio I'm going to remove those
            and add actual projects that I'm working on or have completed.
