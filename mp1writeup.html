      <h2 class="overview">Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li>For this project, I built a Chrome extension that replaces the
              user's cursor with a Rilakkuma. To run the code, you will need to
              follow these steps:
              <ol>
                <li>Download the code for the extension (File name is CryptoBase).</li>
                <li>Open the <a href="chrome://extensions/">Chrome Extensions</a> page.</li>
                <li>Turn on "Developer mode" in the top right corner of the page.</li>
                <li>At the top, click the "Load unpacked" button.</li>
                <li>Locate where on your computer the extension was saved, and upload the file.</li>
                <li>Click the puzzle icon at the top of your browser window, next to the website URL.</li>
                <li>Pin "Rilakkuma Buddy" by clicking the pin button.</li>
                <li>Navigate to a new website that isn't Google.</li>
                <li>Click the Rilakkuma Buddy icon, and enjoy your new Rilakkuma cursor!</li>
              </ol>
              </li> <br>
            <li>
              Here is a gif of my Chrome extension in action:

          </ol>
        </p>
        <h2 class="development process">Development Process</h2>
        <p>I broke up MP1 into several steps to complete the project:
          <ol>
            <li>For this project, I first had to download the extension toolkit
              that was provided to us on GitHub.</li>
            <li>I played around with the sample extensions provided to get a sense
              of how the pieces were all working together to create this final
              product that the user experiences.</li>
            <li>Then, I created my own folder to keep the contents of the extension.</li>
            <li>In this folder, I created several new files, including a manifest.json,
              popup.html, popup.css, and popup.js. I also added all of the
              images that were needed for this extension.</li>
            <li>I updated the manifest.json to represent the extension, and
              wrote the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in each file, debugging
              along the way.</li>
            <li>I ran into an error in the middle, which was that my code only
              worked when I opened it on Live Server and not as an actual Chrome
              Extension. Here is when it was opened in the Live Server:</li>
              <img
                class="picture"
                src="images/screenshot2.jpg"
              />
            <li>Lastly, I uploaded my extension into Google Chrome in the
              developer mode to test it out, and wrote out the MP1 writeup.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      <h2 class="issue">Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>An issue I ran into during MP1 was getting my Chrome extension to work.
             While the extension worked in my live server, it was not working as
             an actual Chrome extension previously.</p>
          <p> To fix this issue, I had to set the cursor to be the image of the
            Rilakkuma in the popup.css file, and I commented out a lot of
            unnecessary code. I also added the popup.js file into the "content_scripts"
            section of the manifest.json file.</p>
          <p> Finally after all this, it started working as expected.</p>

      <h2 class="ideasandfuture">Ideas and Future</h2>
      <p>Here are some ideas and features I might like to add to my site in the
        future:
        <ul>
          <li> Making the Rilakkuma cursor faded when the user clicks down on
            their mouse.</li> <br>
          <li> Creating a pop up that allows the user to choose from some options
            of different Rilakkumas to set as their cursor.</li> <br>
          <li> Maybe sometime in the future I'll consider publishing the
            extension on Google.</li> <br>
        </ul>
      </p>
