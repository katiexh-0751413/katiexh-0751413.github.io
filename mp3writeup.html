      <h1 class="header">MP3 Writeup</h1>
      <h2 class="overview">Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p>For MP3, I decided to recreate Dong Nguyen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Flappy Bird</a> game.
          Here is a gif of the final game in action: <br> <br>
          <IMG SRC="images/mp3gif.GIF" height="300"> <br>
        </p>
        <p>In order to run my game, you can simply open the <a href="https://katiexh-0751413.github.io/MP3game/">Flappy Bird Game</a>
          from the link and play the game directly. Alternatively, you could download the code from my <a href=
        "https://github.com/katiexh-0751413/MP3game">GitHub Respository</a> and run it from your local server.</p>
        <h2 class="development process">Development Process</h2>
        <p>I broke this project up into several steps to complete it:
          <ol>
            <li>First, I followed this <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/platformer/">Platform Tutorial</a> that
              teaches you how to build an endless runner.
            </li> <br>
            <li>Once I got the tutorial working, I began making changes to it to make it gradually
              more similar to a Flappy Bird game. For example, I made the ground all green and the
              obstacles into long rectangles instead of squares randomly scattered across the screen.
              I made two obstacle sprites, an upper and a lower one, then created a gap in between them
              for the player to jump through.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/mp3ip1.png" height="300"> <br>
                <em>In progress screenshot of MP3 Game</em>
            </li> <br>
            <li>Then, I randomized where the gaps will be and loaded in images for the bird, background,
              and ground. I also changed the scoring so that points will only increase by one every time
              the player jumps through a pair of pipes.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/mp3ip2.png" height="300"> <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>Then I loaded in images for the obstacles.<br> <br>
              <IMG SRC="images/mp3final.png" height="300"> <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>Lastly, I loaded in sound for when the player jumps, scores a point, and dies.<br> <br>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      <h2 class="issue">Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>An issue I ran into during MP3 was scaling the pipes properly. When I had set up
            the obstacles to be green rectangles, they scaled fine because I could simply make the
            rectangle longer with no issue: <br> <br>
            <IMG SRC="images/mp3ip2.png" height="300"> <br>
          </p>
          <p>However, when I loaded in images of the pipes to replace the obstacles, it stopped
            producing the randomized gaps in between the pipes: <br> <br>
            <IMG SRC="images/mp3issue2.png" height="300"> <br>
          </p>
          <p>Then when I tried to resize the pipes, it started stretching them out, significantly
            distorting them: <br> <br>
            <IMG SRC="images/mp3issue3.png" height="300"> <br>
          </p>
          <p>To solve this issue, rather than randomly resizing the length of the pipes, I randomly
            repositioned their y position to avoid distorting them. This finally solved the issue: <br> <br>

          </p>

      <h2 class="ideasandfuture">Ideas and Future</h2>
      <p>Here are some ideas and features I might like to add to my project in the
        future:
        <ul>
          <li> Adding in special arcade fonts for the score keeper and end of game message.</li> <br>
          <li> Rather than tapping anywhere to restart, having buttons for "Play Again" or "Quit."</li> <br>
          <li> Including a score tracker that keeps track of the player's highest score, then after a
            game is over displaying both the score from that game as well as the high score. Also, displaying
            the high score at the beginning of the screen. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="kudos">Kudos</h2>
      <p>Here are some resources I found useful while working on this project:
        <ul>
          <li>This <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/platformer/">
            Platformer Tutorial</a></li> <br>
          <li>These <a href="https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/">P5 Examples</a>
              demonstrating P5.play's core functionalities.</li> <br>
          <li><a href="https://repl.it/languages/html">Repl.it</a>'s website, as it allowed me to write my code
              online and run it while seeing the immediate results on my screen. This made debugging my code much
              easier.</li> <br>
        </ul>
