      <h1 class="header">MP3 Writeup</h1>
      <h2 class="overview">Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p>For MP3, I decided to recreate Dong Nguyen's "Flappy Bird" game.</p>
        <h2 class="development process">Development Process</h2>
        <p>I broke this project up into several steps to complete it:
          <ol>
            <li>First, I followed this <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/platformer/">Platform Tutorial</a> that
              teaches you how to build an endless runner.
            </li> <br>
            <li>Once I got the tutorial working, I began making changes to it to make it gradually
              more similar to a Flappy Bird game. For example, I made the ground all green and the
              obstacles into long rectangles instead of squares randomly scattered across the screen.
              I made two obstacle sprites, an upper and a lower one, then created a gap in between them
              for the player to jump through.<br> <br>

                <em>In progress screenshot of MP3 Game</em>
            </li> <br>
            <li>Then, I randomized where the gaps will be and loaded in images for the bird, background,
              and ground. I also changed the scoring so that points will only increase by one every time
              the player jumps through a pair of pipes.<br> <br>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      <h2 class="issue">Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>An issue I ran into during MP2 was getting Sketch 6 to work as intended.
            I wanted to draw a sine wave in which its wavelength and amplitude depend on
            the frequency and amplitude of the sound waves produced by the user
            dragging their mouse across the screen, respectively. The main difficulty
            of this was scaling it to fit on the display screen appropriately.</p>
          <p> To solve this issue, I had to scale the angle and y accordingly. I
            achieved this by a simple process of trial and error. Eventually I settled
            on scaling the angle by a factor of 0.01, and the y by a factor of 200,
            and this did the trick.</p>

      <h2 class="ideasandfuture">Ideas and Future</h2>
      <p>Here are some ideas and features I might like to add to my project in the
        future:
        <ul>
          <li> Adding in special arcade fonts for the score keeper and end of game message.</li> <br>
          <li> Rather than tapping anywhere to restart, having buttons for "Play Again" or "Quit."</li> <br>
          <li> Loading in music and adding a sound for every pair of pipes the player jumps through, and
            a sound for when the player dies.</li> <br>
          <li> Including a score tracker that keeps track of the player's highest score, then after a
            game is over displaying both the score from that game as well as the high score. Also, displaying
            the high score at the beginning of the screen. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="kudos">Kudos</h2>
      <p>Here are some resources I found useful while working on this project:
        <ul>
          <li>This <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/platformer/">
            Platformer Tutorial</a></li> <br>
          <li>These <a href="https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/">P5 Examples</a>
              demonstrating P5.play's core functionalities.</li> <br>
          <li><a href="https://repl.it/languages/html">Repl.it</a>'s website, as it allowed me to write my code
              online and run it while seeing the immediate results on my screen. This made debugging my code much
              easier.</li> <br>
        </ul>
